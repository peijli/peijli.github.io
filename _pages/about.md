> Excelling in the magic of turning low-quality caffeine into high-quality engineering solutions for 22 years.

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Michigan College of Engineering, 
majoring in [Computer Science](https://cse.engin.umich.edu) and minoring in [Civil Engineering](https://cee.engin.umich.edu).
I am also enrolled in the U-M [College of Engineering Honors Program](https://honors.engin.umich.edu).
I am planning to pursue a Ph.D. degree starting in Fall 2024, with a focus on heterogeneous computer architecture and high-level synthesis.

I am an extrovert, a communicator, and a team player.
I believe that any successful person or team would "attack each day with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind," as U-M's head football coach Jim Harbaugh proclaims, and I expect nothing less from myself.
Meanwhile, I believe that my diverse experiences in software testing, computer architecture, and transportation engineering, and the interdisciplinary perspective I have gained from them, form my greatest assets.

## Experiences

Please refer to the [Research](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~peijli/research/) page for a detailed list of my research experiences and projects, and to the [Academics](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~peijli/academics/) page for a detailed list of my coursework and academic projects.

My undergraduate research experiences were very much a product of the circumstances I was in.
The COVID-19 pandemic seriously disrupted my freshman and sophomore years of college, as well as access to certain research opportunities that I might otherwise be aware of.
However, I was still fortunate enough to have been able to work on a variety of projects that I am passionate about, despite them not necessarily being in my primary field of interest.
These projects are mostly related to the transportation engineering field, ranging from connected vehicle cybersecurity to human body modeling.
Beyond the concrete deliverables I produced in the form of two academic papers and a conference presentation, I also gained valuable transferrable skills.
These include the ability to work independently and in a team, the ability to pinpoint research problems and design solutions, and the ability to communicate my ideas and results effectively.

In terms of work experience, I worked as a software test engineer intern at [ASML](https://www.asml.com/en) in San Jose, CA during the summer of 2023, where I automated the Brion division's automated regression testing pipeline for computational lithography software.
Before that, I worked as an instructional aide for the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.engin.umich.edu) at the University of Michigan during the winter of 2023, where I managed lab sessions and office hours for the CEE 375: Sensors and Circuits course.
Introducing CEE students to the world of sensors and signal processing was a rewarding experience for me, and I am glad to have been able to help them with their projects.
I spent the summer after my freshman year of college at the Dell EMC subsidiary in my hometown of Shanghai, China, where I performed integration testing on the [VxRail hyperconverged infrastructure](https://www.dell.com/en-us/dt/converged-infrastructure/vxrail/index.htm) software and the [VMware Cloud Foundation software stack](https://www.vmware.com/products/cloud-foundation.html).

## Academic Interest Narrative

I have chosen the career path of an engineer -- or more specifically, a computer architect -- because of my passion for technology, as well as my desire to share that passion with others.
I want to create the next generation of computer systems that will put the brilliance of modern software to its full potential, as well as bring the power of computing to the masses.
In the meantime, my other ambition is to create a world where computer architecture is accessible to all, as much as software development is today.
I believe that the path to get there is through more efficient and more accessible high-level synthesis tools to lower time and monetary costs for designing new domain-specific hardware accelerators.

I am also practically the only person I know combining a Computer Science major with a Civil Engineering minor. 
I wish to go above and beyond what's required for a computer science degree and want to venture deeper into the interdisciplinary application of computing.
I believe that transportation and infrastructure are two such places where computer technologies can make an impact. 
In particular, I believe that if I can put more efficient, reliable, and secure computer systems on the road, I can make a difference by enabling each entity in the transportation system to make use of ever more complex and accurate data and algorithms to make better decisions.

## Service and Leadership

I have been an active member of the [Tau Beta Pi](https://www.tbp.org/home.cfm) [Michigan Gamma Chapter](https://tbp.engin.umich.edu) since the winter of 2023.
I have gone on multiple volunteering events with the chapter, highlighed by my commitment to the Ann Arbor Natural Area Preservation's [Stewardship Workdays](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/Parks-Recreation/NAP/volunteering/Pages/StewardshipWorkdays.aspx) program.

The University of Michigan College of Engineering Honors Program has also connected me with several volunteering opportunities.
The most notable of these was my participation in the Alternative Spring Break, where I traveled to the [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.habitat.org) site in [Des Moines, IA](https://gdmhabitat.org) to build houses for low-income families and put some of my civil engineering know-how to use.

I was a member of the University of Michigan [Engineering Student Government](https://esg.engin.umich.edu) from the fall of 2020 to the winter of 2022.
As a member of the Student Life Committee, I was most notably involved with organizing wellness-related events, such as mindfulness sessions and nature walks in the [Nichols Arboretum](https://mbgna.umich.edu/nichols-arboretum/).
I believe those were the best ways I could serve my fellow students during the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Extracurriculars and Hobbies

This is the part where I get to talk about where I have fun outside of engineering!

In terms of competitive team sports, I have been a member of the University of Michigan [Club Cycling Team](https://www.umcycling.org) since the fall of 2021.
I have been part of multiple teams winning the road cycling championship of the [Midwest Collegiate Cycling Conference](https://www.mwccc.org).
In the meantime, I am also a huge University of Michigan sports fan -- there's no sporting event that I won't watch if my Wolverines are playing, and the amount of school spirit I have is probably unhealthy.

When it comes to slightly more fringe and frivolous interests, I have also been incredibly invested in the [Touhou Project](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki) game series out of Japan.
Try to catch me at an anime convention near you if you can!
