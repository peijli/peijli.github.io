# Recipe Collection

This is a work-in-progress collection of my favorite recipes off the internet that I use almost as-is or with minor modifications.

## Baked Goods

- [Matcha Cookies](https://www.justonecookbook.com/green-tea-white-chocolate-cookies/): My go-to shortbread cookie recipe when I want to make something to share with friends. I cut down on the confectioners' sugar to 2/3 or 3/4 cups to not overpower the matcha flavor while still maintaining the right texture.
- [Buttermilk Biscuits](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/flaky-buttermilk-biscuits/): my staple breakfast item best enjoyed fresh out of the oven with butter and jam. Sausage gravy is also a great addition but often leaves me feeling way too full for the rest of the day. I cut my biscuits into squares instead of rounds for easier portioning and to maximize the number of biscuits I can get out of a batch.
- [Buttermilk Pancakes](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/buttermilk-pancakes-recipe/): for those mornings when I don't even feel like turning on the oven for biscuits. I like to half or quarter the portion size if I don't want to meal prep for the whole week. I always wanted to add frozen blueberries to the batter but they never come out good looking.
- You can see the common thread of combining buttermilk with both baking soda and baking powder in these recipes, which gives a nice rise.
- [Apple Cake](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/french-apple-cake.html): the recipe that earned me the nickname of "chef" in my undergrad co-op house. I like to substitute the rum for apply brandy, calvados, or even armagnac if I have it on hand.
