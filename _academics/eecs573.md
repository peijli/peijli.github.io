In collaboration with [Mason Nelson](https://thomasmasonnelson.com), I gave a lecture on the necessity, architectural foundations, academic research, and industry trends of accelerators for AI/ML applications. This lecture was given as part of the EECS 573 Microarchitecture course at the University of Michigan, taught by [Prof. Todd Austin](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~taustin/).

Learning objectives for this lecture include:

- Characterize common operations in Machine Learning that can be accelerated
- Understand why Machine Learning is an inefficient task for general-purpose processors and why accelerators are necessary
- Become acquainted with various architecture paradigms, both historical and contemporary, to AI accelerator design
- Review current academic research and commercial products that implement the basic architecture paradigms
- Reflect on possible next steps in accelerator design
