## Abstract

Digital human models (DHMs) with high levels of customization
and realism have been widely employed in automotive engineering. Despite
studies investigating the use of DHMs in specific domains, there is a lack of
comprehensive analyses that evaluate the research trends of the field as a
whole. This review proposes and employs a comprehensive, reproducible, and
systematic bibliometric analysis approach, inspired by the PRISMA guidelines,
to summarize the current state and challenges of DHMs in automotive
engineering and to outline future directions. First, this review presents the
general bibliometric distributions of publication and citation growth, research
areas, keyword distribution, and thematic evolution. Furthermore, it offers an
all-inclusive review of the development, validation, and application of DHMs
in various fields of automotive engineering, including ergonomic design and
safety evaluation. Finally, the prospects and challenges of DHMs are discussed
to provide a novel perspective to promote the advancement of this field.
